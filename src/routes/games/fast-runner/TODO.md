# Fast Runner Game Development Plan

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup

-   [ ] **Orchestrator:** Create this TODO.md file. (Done)
-   [ ] **Architect:** Design initial level layout concepts, core mechanics (movement, jumping, collecting items, obstacles), and overall game flow. Document findings in `DESIGN.md`.
-   [ ] **Code:** Set up the basic Svelte 5 component structure in `src/routes/games/fast-runner/+page.svelte` to host the Phaser game canvas.
-   [ ] **Code:** Initialize a basic Phaser 3 instance within the Svelte component. Ensure a blank canvas renders.

## Phase 2: Core Mechanics Implementation

-   [ ] **Code:** Implement player character sprite and basic movement (left/right running).
-   [ ] **Code:** Implement jumping mechanics.
-   [ ] **Code:** Implement basic level rendering based on the design (static platforms).
-   [ ] **Code:** Implement camera follow for the player.

## Phase 3: Level Features & Polish

-   [ ] **Code:** Implement collectible items (e.g., rings).
-   [ ] **Code:** Implement basic obstacles or enemies.
-   [ ] **Code:** Add scoring or a timer.
-   [ ] **Code:** Implement parallax background scrolling.
-   [ ] **Code:** Add sound effects and background music.
-   [ ] **Code:** Refine controls and game feel.

## Phase 4: Testing & Refinement

-   [ ] **Debug/Code:** Test gameplay thoroughly, identify bugs, and refine mechanics.
-   [ ] **Code:** Add unit/integration tests if applicable.
-   [ ] **Orchestrator:** Final review and completion.
