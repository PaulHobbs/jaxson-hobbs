# Fast Runner Game Design - Initial Concepts

## 1. Level Layout Concepts

### Concept 1: Rolling Hills and Slopes

-   **Description:** Levels feature undulating terrain with frequent slopes.
-   **Goal:** Encourage continuous movement and speed by allowing the player to gain momentum on downhill slopes. Uphill slopes act as minor challenges or opportunities for strategic jumps.
-   **Elements:** Gentle slopes, steeper hills, occasional flat sections for platforming challenges, small gaps requiring jumps.

### Concept 2: Verticality and Multiple Paths

-   **Description:** Levels incorporate vertical elements, offering high and low paths.
-   **Goal:** Provide replayability and reward exploration. High paths might be faster but riskier, while low paths are safer but slower.
-   **Elements:** Elevated platforms, lower ground paths, springs or boosters to reach higher areas, simple branching points.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### Player Movement

-   **Running:** Character runs automatically forward. Player controls left/right movement to navigate and adjust speed slightly.
-   **Acceleration:** Gradual acceleration to a maximum speed.
-   **Deceleration:** Gradual deceleration when not actively moving forward or encountering resistance (e.g., uphill).

### Jumping

-   **Basic Jump:** Single jump with a fixed height.
-   **Air Control:** Limited horizontal movement control while in the air.

### Collectibles

-   **Item:** Rings (similar to Sonic).
-   **Effect:** Collecting rings adds to a score counter. Maybe collect 100 rings for an extra life (stretch goal for later phases).

### Obstacles/Hazards

-   **Static Spikes:** Stationary hazards that damage the player upon contact.
-   **Simple Moving Platforms:** Platforms that move horizontally or vertically along a fixed path.

## 3. Game Flow

-   **Objective:** Reach the end of the level.
-   **Secondary Objective:** Collect as many rings as possible along the way to achieve a high score.
-   **Winning:** Reaching the end point.
-   **Losing:** Running out of lives (if implemented later) or falling off the level.

Here is a simple Mermaid diagram illustrating the basic game flow:

    D --> B;
    E --> F[Level Complete];
